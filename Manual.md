<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* **`pip`**: The backend uses Django, and therefore dependencies can be installed using pip
```sh
python3 -m venv env              
source ./env/scripts/activate     
pip  pip install -r requirements.txt                     
```

* **`npm`**: The frontend uses React, and therefore dependencies can be handled using npm 

```sh
npm install  
```

### Running

This will require you to run backend and frontend separately using two terminals.

* Backend

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

* Frontend

```sh
npm start      
```
